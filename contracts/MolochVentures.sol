// Goals
// - Safe Approvals (two-phase)
// - Multi-applicant proposals
// - ERC20 support
// - ERC20 rebalancing
// - Vote delegation
// - Fund Safety
// - Guild Kick
// - Spam Protection

// Usage Patterns
// - rDAI investing (interest rate swaps)
// - provide liquidity on uniswap
// - open a CDP

// Safe Approvals (two-phase)
// - function stageProposal
//   - can be called by anyone
//   - escrows funds
//   - specifies shares / proposal details
// - function submitProposal
//   - members only
// - function abortProposal
//   - any applicant of the proposal

// Multi-applicant proposals
// - stageProposal takes address[], shares[]
//   - allow multi-token tribute per member?

// ERC20 Support
// - how to avoid risk of malicious token?
//   - ATTACK -> escrow bad token, disable token transfers, can no longer process proposals
//   - possible to operate a token whitelist?
//     - before any proposals to interact with a token, it must be added to the whitelist
//       - possibly have a list of approvedERC20s that are set at deployment to save time
//         - or do this as part of a "summoning phase"
//       - this means there are now multiple types of proposals... more complexity
//   - is there a way to remove a token if it breaks / becomes malicious
//     - this might be better than a whilelist because even if we have a whitelist we might want this,
//       but if we just operate a blacklist then we might not need a whitelist
//     - issue -> if we only have 1 proposal track and enforce order, we can't submit a blacklisting proposal
// - probably the best compromise -> whitelist + safeRedeem
//   - if a token breaks before its proposal is processed, no more proposals can be processed
//   - everyone is forced to ragequit...

// ERC20 Rebalancing
// - Proposals to send and receive individual tokens

// Vote Delegation
// - updateDelegates(address[] delegates, uint[] votes)
//   - How to prevent double voting?
//     1. prevent updating delegate if delegate has already voted on a proposal in the voting period, force wait until grace period
//     2. track member whose delegated votes are being used, make sure total votes for a proposal does not exceed member shares
//      - tricky because we need to loop over all members that have delegated to an address when it votes, might require loop
//     3. enforce 1 week (= to voting period) cooldown period for re-assigning shares
//      - tricky because it becomes an attack vector
//   - How to prevent circular delegation?
//     - loop through delegation target, either we find a circle, run out of gas, or find the terminus
//       - if we run out of gas or find a circle, error / fail
//       - otherwise OK

// Fund Safety
// - keeper addresses that can also ragequit funds
// - whitelist of addresses that can be ragequit to
// - force contract wallets?

// Guild Kick
// - proposal to burn shares for a member address
//   1. member address automatically receives tokens
//   2. to help with lost keys, we can also send the funds to an address besides the member address
//     1. obvious attack vector
//     2. might be redundant with authorized addresses to ragequit
//   3. burn shares but don’t give $
//     1. essentially forces member to ragequit to protect their $

// Spam Protection
// - non-linearly increasing proposal deposit cost for the same member to submit multiple proposals
//  - processing fee as a % of proposal deposit
//  - donation as a % of proposal deposit to the Guild Bank (or a Pool)
//  - fee % and donation % can increase non-linearly as well-

// Open Questions
// - Should we keep the 1 week voting / grace periods?

// TODO
// - create an aragon DAO
// - create a DAOStack DAO
